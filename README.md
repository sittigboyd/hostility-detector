Related to my senior thesis work: a project in NLP, social graph theory, and gender. Incomplete.

##Why hostility?
My data specifically pertains to transgender individuals, since computer scientists still seem to operate under the idea
that binary isn't just for computers.

Transgender people are still widely disrespected, and while social media provides great ways to communicate, it can also
allow a lot of negativity to bubble to the surface. I want to identify patterns in aggressive behavior directed at
trans people, and hostility is a good measure of aggression. It's a good starting point, at least.
